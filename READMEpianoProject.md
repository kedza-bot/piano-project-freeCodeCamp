# 🎹 Piano Project – Responsive Web Design

Welcome to my **Piano Project**!  
This project was inspired by a tutorial from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), created as part of my journey learning Responsive Web Design.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a visually appealing piano interface, built with HTML and CSS.  
It’s designed to demonstrate my understanding of:

- The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
- Media queries for responsive design
- Creative layout and styling techniques

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- **Pseudo-elements**: Used `::before` and `::after` to add decorative or functional elements without extra markup.
- **Media Queries**: Made the piano layout responsive, so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **CSS Skills**: Improved my CSS selectors, positioning, and styling for interactive UI components.

## 📱 Responsive Demo

Try resizing your browser or opening on your phone/tablet!  
The piano keys and layout adapt to different screen sizes for the best viewing experience.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with `::before`, `::after`, and media queries)

---

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was built by following freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design curriculum.  
It was a hands-on way to reinforce the concepts of CSS pseudo-elements and responsive layouts.
